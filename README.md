# School-Portfolio
This is my school portfolio showcasing my coding projects from Civil Engineering to Computer Science

✨ Hi! I'm Ysa
I’m a former Civil Engineering student turned Computer Science student, currently learning to code (and survive).
I hope to specialize in Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, or Artificial Intelligence someday.
It’s kinda hard right now—but hey, I’ll pull through. :’)

I use this GitHub to share my school projects, passion projects, and whatever else I build along the way.
I hope I’m still alive by the end of it.

📌 Featured School Works
🧾 Traveler’s Tavern
A Python-based, text-based mock kiosk for a self-ordering restaurant.
Simulates the ordering process, order customization, and receipt generation, all through a command-line interface.
Created as my Computer Fundamental Programming 1 final project back in my first year of Civil Engineering—before I shifted to Computer Science.

🛠️ Python · Text UI · Menu System · Receipt Generation

🎵 Malayan Colleges Mixdown
A rhythm game built in Python and pygame, inspired by DDR, Piano Tiles, and Guitar Hero.
Players hit arrow keys in sync with a custom chiptune remix of the MMCM Hymn—a fun tribute to student life at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao.

✨ Python · pygame · Game Development · Custom Music

Features:

Fast-paced, retro-inspired rhythm gameplay

Custom MMCM Hymn remix in chiptune style

Symbolic gameplay that mirrors the ups and downs of student life

I’m still learning, experimenting, and making mistakes along the way—but that’s all part of the fun.
Thanks for stopping by! 🌱
