# School-Portfolio
This is my school portfolio showcasing my coding projects from Civil Engineering to Computer Science

# ✨ Hi! I'm Ysa (<-- Code Name)

I’m a former Civil Engineering student turned Computer Science student, currently learning to code (and survive).  
I hope to specialize in **Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, or Artificial Intelligence** someday.  
It’s kinda hard right now—but hey, I’ll pull through. :’)

I use this GitHub to share my **school projects, passion projects**, and whatever else I build along the way.  
I hope I’m still alive by the end of it.

<summary> 🧾 <a href="https://github.com/YsaMee/TravelersTavern">Traveler’s Tavern</a></summary>

A Python-based, text-based mock kiosk for a self-ordering restaurant.  
Simulates the ordering process, order customization, and receipt generation, all through a command-line interface.  
Created as my *Computer Fundamental Programming 1 final project* back in my first year of Civil Engineering—where I first fell in love with coding.

> 🛠️ **Python · Text UI · Menu System · Receipt Generation**

<summary> 🎵 <a href="https://github.com/YsaMee/Malayan-Colleges-Mixdown">Malayan Colleges Mixdown</a></summary>

A rhythm game built in Python and pygame, inspired by DDR, Piano Tiles, and Guitar Hero.  
Players hit arrow keys in sync with a custom chiptune remix of the MMCM Hymn—a fun tribute to student life at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao.  
Another *Computer Fundamental Programming 2 final project* which I also did in my Civil Engineering days. lol.

> ✨ **Python · pygame · Game Development · Custom Music**

**Features:**
- Fast-paced, retro-inspired rhythm gameplay
- Custom MMCM Hymn remix in chiptune style
- Symbolic gameplay that mirrors the ups and downs of student life

# Many more to Come!!

I’m still learning, experimenting, and making mistakes along the way—but that’s all part of the fun.  
**Thanks for stopping by!**

~~I dedicated a few of my work to HawtStrokes for inspiring me and motivating me to become as good of a programmer as you.~~
